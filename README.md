# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python
This project follows my work learning sentiment analysis coding on python. Here you will find the base code to the sentiment analysis by Shaumik Daityari. This analysis is just the original code and will be updated in the future by me so it can filter specific conjunctions such as "did not like". In the current state the code can be used to filter statements into postitive and negative sentiments 

You will also find another peice of code that is used to filter sentiments into specific emotions. This code was created by Attreya bhatt and was updated and used for my end of term project at Central Washington University as seen in my portfolio.
